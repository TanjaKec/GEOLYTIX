### About the Workshop

##### The ever emerging Internet of Things (IoT) produces vast amounts of data that can be analysed to gain useful insights into trends. The `R` language is widely used by statisticians for data analysis, and the popularity of R programming has increased greatly in the recent years.

##### In this workshop we will teach you to ‘speak data using `R`’ by taking a step by step approach starting by explaining core programming principles of the `R` programming language, to importing data and employing basic wrangling techniques and grammar of graphics’ philosophy to produce compelling visualisations that can ultimately illustrate useful insights from your data.

##### Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of `R` and you will get to know how to use its tools needed in a typical data science project. We will introduce you to graphical and numerical techniques for exploring the information concealed within a dataset. After we develop an understanding of our data we will use R’s reproducible approach in telling our data story by creating the R-Markdown documents.

##### At the end of the workshop, participants will be able:

-	Access data from different sources into the R environment 
-	Carry out basic data pre-processing & wrangling 
-	Learn to distinguish most appropriate visualisations to be used for any given data challenge
-	Build advanced visualisations: graphs and maps
-	Gain proficiency in data pre-processing, data wrangling and visualization in R by putting acquired knowledge into application, adopting reproducible approach through creation of the RMarkdown documents 


#### You don't need to have previous knowledge of any programming language, so it's ideal for the newcomer to computer programming.


##### You should have access to a laptop.
